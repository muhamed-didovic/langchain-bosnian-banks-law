# Bosnian Banking Law Knowledge Base with Langchain and Supabase

This repository is dedicated to the creation and maintenance of a knowledge base for the "Zakon o bankama Federacije BiH" (Banking Law of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina). Utilizing the advanced natural language processing capabilities of Langchain, we generate a foundational understanding of Bosnian banking regulations and legal stipulations. This allows us to develop an intelligent system that can support banks in navigating through the complexities of Bosnian banking law.

## Features:

- **Langchain Integration**: We leverage Langchain to process and interpret the "Zakon o bankama Federacije BiH". By doing so, we transform the legal text into structured knowledge that can be easily accessed and understood by both our system and its users.

- **Supabase Database**: All generated knowledge is stored in a Supabase database. This robust and scalable database solution not only acts as a secure repository for the accumulated knowledge but also provides powerful querying capabilities. Users can efficiently retrieve specific information regarding Bosnian banking laws, making this system a valuable resource for financial institutions seeking legal clarity and compliance.

- **API Endpoints**: The repository also includes API endpoints for accessing and interacting with the knowledge base. This facilitates seamless integration with existing systems within the banking infrastructure.

## Goals:

The primary goal of this project is to create a reliable and accessible knowledge base that simplifies the interpretation of the "Zakon o bankama Federacije BiH" for banking professionals. By providing an easy-to-use platform for querying and retrieving information, we aim to enhance legal understanding and compliance within the banking sector of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
